### Generate a Word Cloud
For lots of people, Roger Ebert's movie review was the only 
review they needed because he explained the movie in such a way 
that they would know whether they would like it or not.

Wouldn't it be neat if we had a word cloud like this one for 
each of the movies in the top 100 list at RogerEbert.com? 
We can use a Andreas Mueller's Word Cloud Generator in Python to help
