# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## Course Overview
Anaconda
Jupyter Notebooks
The Data Analysis Process
Data Analysis Process - Case Study 1
Data Analysis Process - Case Study 2
Programming Workflow for Data Analysis
Investigate a Dataset


## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

What do you need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. Here are the installation steps:

Download the installer from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Choose the Python 3.6 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer.


## Why this Project?

In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will you'll learn?

After completing the project, you will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process

Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions

Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use

Have experience communicating the results of your analysis

Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code

Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently

Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
