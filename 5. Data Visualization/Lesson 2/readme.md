# Design of Visualizations

## Lesson Overview
Before making visualizations, it is important to understand how visualizations are designed, and what makes a visualization "good" or "bad." Explanatory visualizations utilize specific design principles in order to clearly and accurately convey findings. Design principles can also be useful in the exploratory phase of the data analysis process.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the following topics related to the design of data visualizations.

- What makes a bad visual?
- Levels of measurement and types of data
- Continuous vs. discrete data
- Identifying data types
- What experts say about visual encodings
- Chart Junk
- Data-to-ink ratio
- Design integrity
- Using color and designing for color blindness
- Shape, size, and other tools
