# Video + Text: The Parch & Posey Database

## Entity Relationship Diagrams
An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a common way to view data in a database. Below is the ERD for the database we will use from Parch & Posey. These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:

The names of the tables.
The columns in each table.
The way the tables work together.
You can think of each of the boxes below as a spreadsheet.

## What to Notice
In the Parch & Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):

>- web_events
>- accounts
>- orders
>- sales_reps
>- region

You can think of each of these tables as an individual spreadsheet. Then the columns in each spreadsheet are listed below the table name. For example, the region table has two columns: id and name. Alternatively the web_events table has four columns.

The "crow's foot" that connects the tables together shows us how the columns in one table relate to the columns in another table. In this first lesson, you will be learning the basics of how to work with SQL to interact with a single table. In the next lesson, you will learn more about why these connections are so important for working with SQL and relational databases.

# Text: Map of SQL Content

## Introduction
Throughout the next three lessons, you will be learning how to write Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with a database here in the classroom. You will not need to download any software, and you will still be able to test your skills!

SQL is an extremely in demand skill. [Tons of jobs use SQL](https://www.zippia.com/advice/what-jobs-use-sql/), and in the next lessons you will be learning how to utilize SQL to analyze data and answer business questions.

## Project
The skills you learn in the classroom are directly extendable to writing SQL in other environments outside this classroom. For the project at the end of these lessons, you will download a program that will allow you to write code on your local machine. You will then analyze and answer business questions using data associated with a music store by querying their database.

## Lesson Outline
There are three lessons in this Nanodegree aimed at helping you understand how to write SQL queries. If you choose to take the [Predictive Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008t) or the [Data Analyst Nanodegree programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), these three lessons will also be a part of these programs. However, there is also an additional lesson on Advanced SQL also taught by Derek!

The three lessons in this course aim at the following components of SQL:

>- SQL Basics - Here you will get your first taste at how SQL works, and learn the basics of the SQL language. You will learn how to write code to interact with tables similar to the ones we analyzed in Excel earlier. Specifically, you will learn a little about databases, the basic syntax of SQL, and you will write your first queries!

>- SQL Joins - In this lesson, you will learn the real power of SQL. You will learn about Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and how to join multiple tables together from a relational database. The power to join tables is what really moved companies to adopt this approach to holding data.

>- SQL Aggregations - In this final lesson, you will learn some more advanced features of SQL. You will gain the ability to summarize data from multiple tables in a database.

At the end of these three lessons, you will be ready to tackle the project. The project aims to assure you have mastered these three topics, but you will also see some of the more advanced queries that were not covered in this course. These are just meant to introduce you to the advanced material, but don't feel discouraged if you didn't get these - they were beyond the scope of the class, and they are not required to pass the project!
