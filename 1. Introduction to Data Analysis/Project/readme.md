# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## Course Overview
Anaconda
Jupyter Notebooks
The Data Analysis Process
Data Analysis Process - Case Study 1
Data Analysis Process - Case Study 2
Programming Workflow for Data Analysis
Investigate a Dataset


## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

What do you need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. Here are the installation steps:

Download the installer from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Choose the Python 3.6 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer.


## Why this Project?

In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will you'll learn?

After completing the project, you will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process

Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions

Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use

Have experience communicating the results of your analysis

Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code

Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently

Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings


# PROJECT DETAILS

## Introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

### Step One - Choose Your Data Set
Click this link (available in a Google doc here) to open a document with links and information about data sets that you can investigate for this project. You must choose one of these datasets to complete the project.

### Step Two - Get Organized
Eventually youâ€™ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:

The report communicating your findings

Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis

The data set you used (which you will not need to submit)

You may wish to use a Jupyter notebook, in which case you can submit both the code you wrote and the report of your findings in the same document. Otherwise, you will need to submit your report and code separately. If you would like a notebook template to help organize your investigation, you can click here. Or there may be a page in the project here called Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project, where you can do all your work and submit the project.

### Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options to help you get started.

Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

### Step Four - Share Your Findings
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.

### Step Five - Review
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you're ready to submit your project. If you see room for improvement, keep working to improve your project!
